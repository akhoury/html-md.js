# NO LONGER MAINTAINED!
switched to [to-markdown](https://github.com/domchristie/to-markdown)

# html-md.js

Basically a compiled version of the original [html-md](https://github.com/neocotic/html.md) (so no more coffeescript) + this [pull#43](https://github.com/neocotic/html.md/pull/43) + few other changes

## install

```
npm install html-md.js
```

## usage

```
var md = require("html-md.js");
md("<b>foo</b>");
```

see original docs here: https://github.com/neocotic/html.md

## wtf? why?

Because i found my self keep editing that [fork](https://github.com/akhoury/html-md-optional_window) in coffeescript, and 1 day I gave up, so. Also the original [repo]() doesn't seem to be active anymore.
